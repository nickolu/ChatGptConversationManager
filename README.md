# ChatGPT Conversation Manager

- save and tag your converstaions
- filter conversations by tag

This extension does not make any external API calls or collect any user data. It uses the browser's indexedDb API to save your conversations, which is a a client-side, web-based database storage system that allows developers to store and manage complex data structures within a user's browser. Clearing your browser cache/history will not delete your data, however if you uninstall chrome you will lose your data. We'll add a way to back up your saved conversations and tags in the future.
